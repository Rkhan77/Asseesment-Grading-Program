# Asseesment-Grading-Program

Hello! I am excited to introduce my project to you. My project is Asseesment-Grading-Program. This project is important to me because it helped to learn how to code. I have put a lot of time and effort into this project and I hope you enjoy it. Thank you for taking the time to check out my project!

Assessments Grades program allows the user first specify the assessments that exist in a unit, and then to enter the marks that each student received for those assessments. The program uses this information to determine and display information such as student grades (e.g. “Distinction”). The program displays information on both a per-student / perassessment basis, as well as some aggregated data such as a class average.
